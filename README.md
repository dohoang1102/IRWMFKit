# IRWMFKit!

Evadne Wu at Iridia Productions, 2011.

## Overview

*	WMF ➡ CGImageRef
*	App Store compatible.

## Why?

Because **wv** and **UniConverter** are both GPL/LGPL, and GPL/LGPL is incompatible with the App Store.

### Licensing & Disclaimer

Code is licensed under the New BSD license, and needs attribution: “IRWMFKit © 2011–, Evadne Wu / Iridia Productions”, in the final product, unless explicitly permitted otherwise.

Code is not tested in all cases — who knows what might be lurking in that WMF, as with all stuff Microsoft — but test cases in the project should execute without failing.
